Overall this is built badly. On looking back at this project I can see massive ways I can improve the quality of the code, security of the repo, etc. When building it I had to learn everything on the spot, and because of that a lot of things were not done very efficiently. One of the main drawbacks is the file structure, which is based somewhat on how I learned to do things for native iOS development.
